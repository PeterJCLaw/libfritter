Subject: An example template.

This is an exmaple template, which is also used in the tests.

The first line of the file is expected to begin 'Subject:' and is
then followed by the subject line of the email. No replacements
occur within the subject line.

The main body of the email then follows, and can optionally have
items for replacement, delimited by curly braces, like this: {foo}.
These will be replaced by whatever value is given in the template_vars
dict passed to the send_email_template function in the mailer module,
using the string within the braces as the key.
