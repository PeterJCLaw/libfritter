Subject: A short email





    TEST-TOP
This template has a lot of empty lines at the top and bottom, as well as
in the middle.




Clearly, it's not a very useful email with this much space, but the gaps
at the top and bottom just get in the way and should be removed.




The makers present here are just so it's easy to test that the right lines
have been removed.
