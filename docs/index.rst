Welcome to LibFritter's documentation!
======================================

Libfritter contains the core email sending components of `Student Robotics`__'
user management and user mailing software. In both cases it operates on
email templates stored as plaintext files.

__ https://www.studentrobotics.org

It is not generally useful on its own, other than the ``preview`` script
which allows individual templates to be previewed, optionally restricting
the preview to use a collection of valid placeholders.
